read_checkpoint

Description: 
Read a design checkpoint

Syntax: 
read_checkpoint  [-cell <arg>] [-incremental] [-directive <arg>]
                 [-auto_incremental] [-fix_objects <args>]
                 [-dcp_cell_list <args>] [-quiet] [-verbose] [<file>]

Usage: 
  Name                 Description
  --------------------------------
  [-cell]              Replace this cell with the checkpoint. The cell must 
                       be a black box.
  [-incremental]       Input design checkpoint file to be used for re-using 
                       implementation.
  [-directive]         Mode of behavior (directive) for this command. Please 
                       refer to Arguments section of this help for values for
                       this option.
                       Default: RuntimeOptimized
  [-auto_incremental]  Enters automatic mode for incremental compile. This is
                       less aggressive than the standard incremental mode and
                       will readily switch from incremental algorithms to the
                       default algorithms if results might not be maintained.
                       Should not be used with -reuse_objects.
  [-fix_objects]       Fix only given list of cells, clock regions, SLRs or

Description:

  Reads a design checkpoint file (DCP) that contains the netlist,
  constraints, and may optionally have the placement and routing information
  of an implemented design. You can save design checkpoints at any stage in
  the design using the write_checkpoint command.

  The read_checkpoint command simply reads the associated checkpoint file,
  without opening a design or project in-memory. To create a project from the
  imported checkpoint, use the open_checkpoint command instead of
  read_checkpoint, or use the link_design command after read_checkpoint to
  open the in-memory design from the checkpoint or checkpoint files currently
  read.

  Note: When multiple design checkpoints are open in the Vivado tool, you
  must use the current_project command to switch between the open designs.
  You can use current_design to check which checkpoint is the active design.

  Note: The -incremental switch is not intended to merge two DCP files into a
  single design. It applies the placement and routing of the incremental
  checkpoint to the netlist objects in the current design.

  After loading an incremental design checkpoint, you can use the
  report_incremental_reuse command to determine the percentage of physical
  data reused from the incremental checkpoint, in the current design. The
  place_design and route_design commands will run incremental place and
  route, preserving reused placement and routing information and
  incorporating it into the design solution.

  Reading a design checkpoint with -incremental, loads the physical data into
  the current in-memory design. To clear out the incremental design data, you
  must either reload the current design, using open_run to open the synthesis
  run for instance, or read a new incremental checkpoint to overwrite the one
  previously loaded.

Arguments:

  -cell <arg> - (Optional) Specifies a black box cell in the current design
  to populate with the netlist data from the checkpoint file being read. This
  option cannot be used with -incremental, or any of its related options.

  -auto_incremental - (Optional) Enables incremental algorithms only when the
  quality of the reference checkpoint is high. This allows a user to set this
  option and let the tool decide whether to run default or incremental
  algorithms.

  -incremental - (Optional) Load a checkpoint file into an already open
  design to enable the incremental implementation design flow, where <file>
  specifies the path and filename of the incremental design checkpoint (DCP)
  file. In the incremental implementation flow, the placement and routing
  from the incremental DCP is applied to matching netlist objects in the
  current design to reuse existing placement and routing. Refer to the Vivado
  Design Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for more information on
  incremental implementation.

  -directive [ RuntimeOptimized | TimingClosure | Quick ] - (Optional)
  Specifies a directive, or mode of operation for the -incremental process.

   *  RuntimeOptimized: The target WNS is the referenced from the incremental
      DCP. By default, more reuse from the reference checkpoint is
      encouraged.

   *  TimingClosure: The target WNS is 0. This mode attempts to meet timing
      at the expense of runtime. Paths not meeting timing will be ripped up
      and the incremental algorithms will be applied to fix timing on the
      paths.

   *  Quick: Specifies a low effort, non-timing-driven incremental
      implementation mode with the fastest runtime.

  -reuse_objects <args> - (Optional) For use with the -incremental option, to
  read and reuse only a portion of the checkpoint file, this option specifies
  to reuse only the placement and routing data of the specified list of
  cells, clock regions, and SLRs from the incremental checkpoint.

  Note: When this option is not specified, the whole design will be reused.
  The -reuse_objects options can be used multiple times to reuse different
  object types. See examples below.

  -fix_objects - (Optional) When -incremental is specified, mark the
  placement location of specifed cells as fixed (IS_LOC_FIXED) to prevent
  changes by the place_design command. This option will fix the placement of
  the specified list of cells, clock regions, SLRs or the current_design.

  -dcp_cell_list <arg> - (Optional) Lets you specify a list of cell/dcp
  pairs. This lets you read in multiple DCP files for specified cells in a
  single run of the read_checkpoint command. The format is specified as a
  list of cell/DCP pairs enclosed in curly braces: {<cell1> <dcp1> <cell2>
  <dcp2>}.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The path and filename of the checkpoint file to read.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example imports the specified checkpoint file into the tool,
  and then links the various design elements to create an in-memory design of
  the specified name:

    read_checkpoint C:/Data/checkpoint.dcp  
    link_design -name Test1 
    

  This example reads a design checkpoint on top of the current design for
  incremental place and route of the design:

    read_checkpoint -incremental C:/Data/routed.dcp 
    

  This example reads a design checkpoint. Incremental algorithms will be used
  only if the timing is nearly met and if there is a high reuse:

    read_checkpoint -auto_incremental C:/Data/routed.dcp

  Reuse and fix the placement and routing associated with the DSPs and Block
  RAMs:

    read_checkpoint -incremental C:/Data/routed.dcp \  
    -reuse_objects [all_rams] -reuse_objects [all_dsps] -fix_objects [current_design] 
    

  Note: The -reuse_objects option could also be written as:

    -reuse_objects [get_cells -hier -filter {PRIMITIVE_TYPE =~ BMEM.*.* || PRIMITIVE_TYPE =~ MULT.dsp.* }] 
    

  The following example reuses the placement and routing of the cells inside
  the hierarchical cpuEngine cell, and fixes the placement of the DSP cells:

    read_checkpoint -incremental C:/Data/routed.dcp -reuse_objects [get_cells cpuEngine] -fix_objects [all_dsps]
